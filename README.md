# Diabetes-ML-prediction-end-to-end-project
Diabetes-ML-prediction-end to end project created web app in flask and deployed in Heroku


Here, I have developed a Diabetes disease predicting web app which using the concept of machine learning makes predictions.
Dataset Name : pima diabetes dataset
Tools used for this project: Python (3.8 version), Fask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, HTML, Flask, Heroku

Machine Learning pip line:

  1. Data Gathering - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
  2. Feature Engineering - Handle missing values, Outliers
  3. Feature Selection - Hyperparameterization RandomizedSearchCV
  4. Model creation - RandomForestClassifier
  5. Model Deployment - Flask, Heroku
    
    
The whole project is deployed on Heroku Cloud.
